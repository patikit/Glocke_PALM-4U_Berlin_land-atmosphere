# Glocke_PALM-4U_Berlin_land-atmosphere
To study the coupling between atmospheric and subsurface energy fluxes in Berlin, we provide the p3d files, the static driver as well as the dynamic driver for different scenarios. The analysis was done with the turbulence and building resolving large eddy simulation urban climate model PALM-4U 23.10.
